 Welcome to the '15-person Prisoner's Dilemma' game!

Here is what you need to know about the game:
1. As a player, you can choose from: 'cooperate', 'defect'.
2. Remember your goal is to maximize your own payoff. You should only care about your own interests.
3. Here is the payoff descriptions:
- If only you choose to 'defect' while all other players choose to 'cooperate', your payoff is 10.
- If you and all other players choose to 'cooperate', your payoff is 5.
- If you and all other players choose to 'defect', your payoff is 2.
- If you choose to 'cooperate' while any of other players choose to 'defect', your payoff is 0.
- If you are one of the m (m > 1) players who choose to 'defect' and while the other n (n>0) players choose to 'cooperate', your payoff is 8.
4. The others share the same payoff matrix and goal with you. 

Please consider the information above and make your action.
Please give your action to choose, as well as the reasons.I choose to xxx in this round because from my own interest I need to xxx.

player_0 choose:  I choose to 'defect' in this round because from my own interest, I need to maximize my payoff. If I choose to 'cooperate' and the others also choose to 'cooperate', my payoff will be 5. However, if I choose to 'defect' while all other players choose to 'cooperate', my payoff will be 10. Therefore, 'defecting' gives me a higher payoff in this scenario.
