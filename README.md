# Multi Agent Hackathon Code Repository

Welcome to our code repository for the [Multi Agent Hackathon](https://alignmentjam.com/jam/multiagent)! This hackathon focused on discovery the failure in the multi-agent systems. Our team worked on **Scaling Laws of LLM Cooperation**, and this repository provides an in-depth look at our code and results.

Our exploration answer a interesting question that, will the failure cases exacerbate as the number of agents increases? 
To demonstrate this, we let LLMs play the **n-player Prisonerâ€˜s Dilemma**, our results demonstrate that the LLM agents experienced **unintended failure as the scale of agents increased**.
